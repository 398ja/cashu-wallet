- Add unit tests for new functionality, covering edge cases.
- Ensure modifications to existing code do not break functionality and pass all tests.
- Add integration tests for new features to verify end-to-end functionality.
- Ensure new dependencies or configurations do not introduce security vulnerabilities.
- Maintain the versions in the configuration section of the pom.xml files.
- Add a comment on top of every test method to describe the test in plain English.
